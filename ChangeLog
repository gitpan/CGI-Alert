	* Release 1.08

	* Alert.pm:
	  Bug 8033 - check $^S properly.  Again, thanks to Don At
	  See-Pan Dot Org for finding this and providing a patch.

	* Alert.pm: PHEW!  Finally!  Configurable user output.  The
	  message shown to the remote (web) user is now configurable.
	  Feature Request 7788.  Thanks to Don At See-Pan Dot Org for
	  the idea.

	* Alert.pm:
	  Eek!  @Hide is wrong: it won't detect a simple name like 'password'
	  (that is, if it starts with 'passw' instead of being 'mumble-passw').

	* Alert.pm:
	  when displaying CGI params, only default to '' if param is undef!
	  Otherwise, we show zero (0) as ''.

	* Alert.pm:
	  $http_host - split into two: a _full_ portion, and an
	  _email hostname_ one.  The difference is that the full one
	  might have colon-port (:80, :8080, ...).  That's important
	  for showing the full URL in the subject line, but a major
	  bad thing to say "From: <nobody@foo.com:80>".

	* Release 1.05

2004-03-05  Eduardo Santiago <esm@pobox.com>
	* Alert.pm: include $HTTP_HOST in email From: header, to
	  help differentiate between virtual hosts

2004-03-04  Eduardo Santiago <esm@pobox.com>
	* Alert.pm: new exportable function http_die(), provides
	  simple way for caller to emit an HTTP error (404, 500, ...)

2003-11-07  Eduardo Santiago <esm@pobox.com>
	* Release 1.02

2003-10-02  Eduardo Santiago <esm@pobox.com>

	* Alert.pm: new functionality: if called with 'hide=qr/xxx/'
	  on the import line, exclude CGI params matching /xxx/ from
	  generated email.  Used to avoid sending sensitive info
	  (passwords, credit card numbers) over unencrypted email.

	* t/02hide.t: new test, for above functionality
