=head1	NAME

CGI::Alert - report CGI script errors to maintainer

=head1	SYNOPSIS

    use CGI::Alert 'youraddress@your.domain';

That's all.  Everything else is transparent to your script.

Or:

    use CGI::Alert qw(you@your.domain http_die);
    ...
    my $foo = param('foo')
      or http_die '400 Bad Request', '<b>foo</b> param missing';

The B<http_die> function provides a one-call mechanism for emitting
an HTTP error status with a helpful message.  This is intended
mostly for handling B<assert>-style situations: you want to make
sure you don't continue past a bad point.


=head1	DESCRIPTION

CGI::Alert will inform you by email of warnings and errors (from B<die>
or from exiting with nonzero status).

If the script terminates normally (exit status 0), and no warnings were
issued by the script or by Perl, CGI::Alert is a no-op.  It just consumes
resources but has no other effect.

If the script terminates normally, but has issued B<warnings> (either
directly via C<warn>, or by Perl itself from the C<warnings> pragma),
CGI::Alert will send you an email message with the first 10 of those
warnings, plus other details (see below).

If the script terminates via B<die>, CGI::Alert sends you an email
message with the details.  It also displays a big 'Uh-Oh' on the
remote web user's browser, informing him/her that an error has
occurred, and that the maintainer has been notified.

CGI::Alert is useful for letting you know of problems in your
scripts.  It's also useful for adding FIXMEs: you can leave
unimportant-seeming sections unimplemented, but put a "warn"
statement in them.  If you get email from that section, you
know your users have a need for that functionality.

=head2	Maintainer Address

To specify the email address that will be notified of problems,
include it in the import list:

    use CGI::Alert 'esm@pobox.com';

or, more typically:

    use CGI::Alert 'esm';   # where 'esm' is a local account

=head2	Hiding Sensitive Data

Forms often contain sensitive data: passwords, credit card numbers,
next Tuesday's winning Lotto numbers.  CGI::Alert sends unencrypted
email, and you don't want these values being intercepted.

To exclude CGI parameters from the list sent by email, use
the B<hide=qr/.../> keyword on the import line:

    use CGI::Alert 'esm', 'hide=qr/credit/i';

If CGI::Alert encounters any parameter matching the given regex, it
substitutes B<[...]> (bracket, ellipsis, bracket) for its value:

    card_type       = Visa
    card_name       = Joe Bob
    credit_card_num = [...]

Multiple expressions are allowed, but must be specified
using one B<hide=> for each:

    use CGI::Alert 'esm', 'hide=qr/credit/i', 'hide=qr/passphrase/';

The default exclusion list is B<qr/(^|[\b_-])passw/i>

=head2	Running under tilde URLs

CGI::Alert checks the C<REQUEST_URI> environment variable.  If it
detects a URL of the form B</~something> (slash, tilde, something)
CGI::Alert overrides the maintainer address, sending email only to
the B<something> following the tilde.

=head2	Specifics: email

On any C<die>, or if the CGI script has issued warnings, CGI::Alert
sends an email message to the maintainer with the following details:

=over 2

=item *

The B<URL> used to access the page

=item *

The B<error message> emitted by C<die>, with complete stack trace.

=item *

Any B<warnings> issued by the script (well, just the first 10), with full
stack trace.

=item *

The remote B<user name> (if known) and B<host name/address>

=item *

A full list of CGI B<parameters> passed to the script.  CGI::Alert
relies on the C<param> function provided by CGI.pm for this.

=item *

A full list of process B<environment variables> and their settings.

=item *

The expanded results of B<%INC>, showing all loaded modules and their
paths.  This can help when the problem is an obsolete version of a
module.

=back

=head2	Specifics: WWW

If the script C<die>s, a large heading will be shown in
red typeface, saying "Uh-Oh!".  The error will be displayed, along
with a note saying that the maintainer has been notified by email.

The remote (web) user is not informed of warnings.

=head1	EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

CGI::Alert provides one exportable function (not exported by default):

=over 2

=item *

http_die ['--no-alert',] B<HTTP Status>, B<Blurb for User>

B<http_die> provides a simple way for you to assert a
condition and provide a safe way to handle assertion failure.

For example, if your CGI script is guaranteed always to be called
with the B<item_number> parameter set, you can write:

    my $item = param('item_number')
      or http_die '400 Bad Request','Missing item_number param';
    $item =~ m!^([a-z][a-z0-9]+)$!
      or http_die '400 Bad Request',"Bad item number '$item'";
    $item = $1; # untaint.  We've validated that it's correct.

    exists $Catalog{$item}
      or http_die '--no-alert','404 Not Found',"$item: No such item";

This lets you guard against people trying to sneak in with
forged requests.  It also lets you check for "can't possibly
happen" conditions in your code.  Not that these ever happen.

http_die uses B<warn> on its input, to make sure it goes to the
server log.  This means you also get email notification when it
happens.  To prevent getting an email notification on common
occurrences (such as the 404 above), use B<--no-alert> as the
first argument to http_die.

=head2	Custom Headers

You want your error messages to conform to your site standards:
stylesheets, etc.

http_die() will use B<start_html> if CGI.pm is loaded.  You
can pass extra arguments to start_html via B<extra_html_headers()> :

    use CGI::Alert ('yourname', 'http_die');

    # We issue these below, when we call start_html()
    our @Common_Headers = (
		-author  => 'esm@pobox.com',
                -head    => Link({-rel  => 'shortcut icon',
                                  -href => '/my.ico',
                                  -type => 'image/x-icon',
                                 }),
		-style   => {
			     -src  => '/my.css',
                            },
                          );

    # If we ever call http_die(), make it use the above
    CGI::Alert::extra_html_headers( @Common_Headers );

=head2	Custom Browser Text

In the event of a die(), CGI::Alert will display the following
message to the remote (browser) user:

  <h1><font color="red">Uh-Oh!</font></h1>
  <p>
  The script which was handling your request died, with the following error:
  </p>
  <pre>
      [MSG]
  </pre>
  <p>
  If that indicates a problem which you can fix, please do so.
  </p>

...where C<[MSG]> gets replaced with the error from C<die>().

Use B<CGI::Alert::custom_browser_text> to customize the text message
displayed to the remote user (the browser).  The simple way is to
pass a string:

  # Show custom text to remote viewer
  CGI::Alert::custom_browser_text << '-END-';
  <h1>Yowzers!</h1>
  <p>
  We crashed with: <blink>[MSG]</blink>
  </p>
  -END-

As above, C<[MSG]> (open bracket, upper-case MSG, close bracket)
will be replaced with the die() text.

Or, if you want fine-grain control, you can pass a CODE ref:

  # Your function must take TWO arguments
  sub my_text_func($$) {
    my $msg = shift;                      # in: Perl error message
    my $emit_http_headers = shift;        # in: Emit HTTP status?

    if ($emit_http_headers) {
      print  "Status: 500 Server Error\n"
             "Content-type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\n",
             "\n";
    }

    if ($msg =~ /frobbledygrunt/) {
      # ...do something special
    }
    else {
      print "<h1>Ouch!</h1>\n",
            "<p>Died with:</p>",
            "<div class='foo'>",$msg,"</div>\n";
    }

    # Important!  Return 1, to tell CGI::Alert we were successful
    return 1;
  }

  CGI::Alert::custom_browser_text \&my_text_func;

=head1	REQUIREMENTS

CGI::Alert requires a properly configured C<sendmail> executable
in C</usr/sbin> or C</usr/lib>.  This does not need to be Sendmail
itself: Postfix, Exim, and other MTAs provide this executable.

=head1	BUGS

If the script dies before emitting the 'Status' and 'Content-Type'
headers (e.g. because of a compile-time syntax error), the remote
user will see the dreaded '500 Server Error' page.  Since this only
really happens when the CGI script fails to compile, this will only
ever be seen by the CGI script developer and hence is not a big deal.

As a workaround for this, you can do:

    CGI::Alert::emit_http_headers(1);

This tells CGI::Alert to emit HTTP Status and Content-type headers
before displaying the Uh-Oh message.
