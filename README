CGI::Alert version 2.08
=======================

CGI::Alert notifies a developer of problems in a CGI script.

Usage is simple.  Insert this line near the top of your CGI script:

	use CGI::Alert	'My Name <my.addr@my.domain>';

If the script terminates abnormally (e.g. via 'die'), or if there
are warnings emitted during execution, an email message is sent
to the given address with details of the failure.  If termination
is due to 'die', a friendly message is displayed to the web user.


INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

CGI::Alert uses the 'param' function from CGI.pm, if available.

CGI::Alert requires a working /usr/sbin/sendmail or /usr/lib/sendmail.
